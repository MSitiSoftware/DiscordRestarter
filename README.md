# DiscordRestarter
The DiscordRestarter is a program (For windows) that will fully restart Discord. You'll not need to open Task Manager or use the taskkill.exe command from Command Prompt.


Can be that this specific DiscordRestarter version will not work on any Operating System other than Windows 10.


The DiscordRestarter works as a batch file in the background that will automatically kill the Discord.exe and then run it right back on. If you're using the DiscordRestarter Version 0.0 it will run without Working On Background mode and as a Console Log mode, so you can see how the program is doing right now, and even enter a command if you'd like to restart again or just exit.
